          <p class="h4 text-start border border-2 rounded p-4">As a full-stack web developer, I have been working on my skills in website development for almost 3years now. 
            My journey began in 2021 when I enrolled at Kwekwe Polytechnic to pursue a course in Information Technology. 
            However, even before joining the polytechnic, I had already developed a passion for coding. 
            It all started when I was supplementing my failed O level maths results. During the day, I would dedicate my time to studying mathematics, and at night, I would delve into learning different programming languages<br><br>
          My initial exposure was to the C++ language, which opened up a whole new world of programming for me. 
          Despite the limitations of coding on a phone without a computer, I managed to grasp the basics of C++ and create simple console-based programs like a calculator app. 
          But I didn't let these limitations stop me from expanding my horizons as a programmer. <br><br>
          One day, I came across an ad about web design, and it sparked my interest in web technologies. From that point on, I made it my mission to gather as much information as possible about web
          development. I learned about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and through building my own
          websites, I gained practical experience in the craft. <br><br>
          Fast forward, I successfully passed my mathematics exam with an A grade and enrolled at
          Kwekwe Polytechnic. It was at this institution that I met remarkable individuals who helped me
          evolve and grow as an individual. I transformed from being a shy kid from Mbizo to a
          charismatic class representative with a spotless record of professionalism and great leadership
          qualities. <br><br>
          During my early days as a first-year student, I was fortunate to join a coding club that had just
          been established. This period marked the most challenging and exciting time of my college life. I juggled between my college assignments and club projects, which honed my ability to
          multitask. By the end of my first year, I was proud to be among the three students in my
          class of 50 IT students who passed National Certificate level. <br> <br>
          Moving into my second year, the time flew by, and I eagerly prepared for my industrial
          attachment. I applied to various companies but received no responses, until finally, I received an
          interview invitation from a web design company. They were highly impressed with my
          knowledge of web technologies and offered me a full-time job as a frontend developer. However, I declined the offer as I wanted to complete my education before entering the workforce.
          Instead, I decided to do my attachment at Kwekwe Poly. <br> <br>
          Initially, I wasn't thrilled about working at the same institution where I was studying because I
          wanted to experience different work environments. Surprisingly, doing my attachment at
          Kwekwe Polytechnic turned out to be a blessing. I received training in various areas of IT, from
          hardware to software. Interacting with students as a member of the staff also helped me
          develop valuable people skills. My hard work and dedication led the college to select me as their
          representative for off-campus events. I had the opportunity to attend the 2023 Gweru Innovation
          Show on behalf of Kwekwe Polytechnic, which proved to be an amazing learning experience. I
          explored other company exhibits, gaining insights and knowledge. We were thrilled to win the
          best college category, an unforgettable experience. <br> <br>
          Throughout my attachment, I continued to learn and grow as an IT professional. I represented
          Kwekwe Polytechnic at the KWEKWE EXPO 2023, where we achieved success once again. My
          time at Kwekwe Polytechnic was truly a blessing, as I gained valuable insights into working in
          the IT industry and was able to apply theoretical knowledge in practical. <br> <br>
          My attachment period, together with my three workmates, concluded in January 2024 with a clean
          record. However, in 2024, I was unable to return to class for my final year due to significant
          accumulated fees arrears from 2023. Currently, I am working towards clearing those arrears
          while simultaneously running my own web design company, 'MunasheWebWorks,' which
          focuses on developing websites for small businesses. I am hopeful for the future and excited
          about the opportunities ahead.</p>
